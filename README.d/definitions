Overview of most used terms and definitions
-------------------------------------------

This application offers a browseable map to discover and access networkservices like SFTP over a secure SSH connection.
To do this I had to introduce some terms and definitions. To demonstrate an example is good:



    /Open Secure Network Services/example.org/Adminserver/home
    |						|	   \
  workspace					|	    \
    mount context			     ssh context  sftp context
    interface				      interface    interface
      fuse				      ssh client    sftp client


Workspace
---------

A workspace is a synonym for the mountpoint: everything general for the whole browseable map belings here, like:
- mountpoint
- inode lookup hashtable
- root inode and entry
- list of context services used on the browseable map


Services context and context interface
--------------------------------------

A context is the bridge between the fuse filesystem and the backend, like a SSH connection.
