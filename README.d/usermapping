   USERMAPPING
   ===========

1. Intro

When working with network filesystems, the system by definition is confronted by different
user and group subsystems on client and server. In special cases network filesystems can assume
they are the same, when for example a shared database is used like Active Directory and OpenLDAP.
In these cases usermapping is not required since users on both client and server are the same.

In the general case when a osns client connects with a server, there is at this moment no way
it can determine easy the users/groups are shared and the same, and no mapping is required.

Here are some facts which are important when it comes to users and groups in SFTP and other
network filesystems.

A. Since some years uid's and gid's for human users are starting at a default.
For most systems the minumum is 1000, for both the uid as the gid.
Om Linux systems these are defined in /etc/login.defs.

B. SFTP uses the attr struct to communicate the properties of files between server and client.
Unfortunatly the way this is done changed between the different protocol versions:
- version 3, owner and group are communicated via the uid and gid resp.
- version > 3, owner and group are communicated as user@domain and group@domain resp.
